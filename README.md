#the 20% testing and 80% training model has the highest accuracy because it has a larger portion of the dataset for training which makes it better learning.
#the 50% testing and 50% training model has a balanced amaount of dataset for training and testing resulting in a balanced testing accuracy
#the 30% training and 70% testing model has the lowest accuracy, this is because the model has less data to learn from which might lead to underfitting
